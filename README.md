# Big-Data
Accidents caused by large trucks remain one of the leading causes of injuries and deaths in the United States. 
ANT as a long-distance trucking service company, would like to ensure that all the drivers are compliant and do not present any insurance risk. 
So, they can focus on improving the business. Our main objective of project is to identify the dangerous truck drivers and the factors affecting 
the behavior of these drivers. Based on the analysis, revise truck movements and rules to mitigate risk and increase safety.

As part of the project, we need to analyze the truck fleet data and understand risk. First load the data into local. 
Then transfer the files to HDFS. Load data into Hive. Create required tables in Hive. 
Connect Hadoop to Tableau/Power BI using Hive ODBC driver to create visualizations. 
Using Hadoop tools and techniques we processed the data and created visualizations to benefit decision making.
